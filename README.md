## 🚀 Project Overview

This Power BI project delivers a data-driven cybersecurity training analysis using simulated phishing campaign data. The dashboards are structured for three key personas:

- **Phishing Campaign Manager**
- **Individual Employee**
- **HR Manager**

Each dashboard empowers organizations to identify high-risk departments, evaluate training effectiveness, and optimize security awareness strategies using interactive visual analytics.

## 💡 Dashboard Insights (Chart Type + Key Finding)

### 🔹 Phishing Campaign Manager Dashboard

Provides an overview of phishing campaign performance and helps optimize strategy and resource use.

- **Chart 1 – Distribution of Campaign Budget**  
  *Type:* Pie Chart  
  *Insight:* Whaling and Business Email Compromise campaigns received the highest budgets (25.86% and 22.41%). This indicates strategic prioritization of higher-risk campaign types.

- **Chart 2 – Emails Sent vs. Emails Opened by Campaign**  
  *Type:* Clustered Bar Chart  
  *Insight:* PhishLock Drive had the highest email open rate, while CyberSafe Sweepstakes had the lowest. This suggests differences in campaign appeal and subject line effectiveness.

- **Chart 3 – Average Click Rate Pre and Post Training Follow-Up**  
  *Type:* Clustered Column Chart  
  *Insight:* Employees who received follow-up training showed significantly lower click rates. This confirms the importance of reinforcement training.

- **Chart 4 – Success Rates of Phishing Campaigns by Department**  
  *Type:* Treemap  
  *Insight:* The IT department showed the highest phishing campaign success rate, followed by Marketing and HR. These departments may require targeted awareness efforts.

- **Chart 5 – Success Rate vs. Budget by Department**  
  *Type:* Combo Chart (Bar + Line)  
  *Insight:* Higher budgets do not guarantee better success rates. For example, TrustGuard Initiative and PhishShield Initiative had similar success rates but different costs.

### 👤 Individual User Performance Dashboard

Offers a detailed view of user behavior, training performance, and susceptibility trends.

- **Chart 1 – Phishing Emails Clicked by Name and Department**  
  *Type:* Bar Chart  
  *Insight:* Employees like Jane Smith and Sophia Lee from Finance clicked the most phishing emails, suggesting a need for targeted retraining.

- **Chart 2 – Average Training Score by Name and Department**  
  *Type:* Bar Chart  
  *Insight:* Chris Green, Mike Johnson, and Emily Davis had the highest training scores, indicating strong understanding; Jessica Adams scored the lowest.

- **Chart 3 – Email Click Rate by Training Status**  
  *Type:* Line Chart  
  *Insight:* Trained employees had lower click rates overall. Jane Smith and Sophia Lee (untrained) had the highest click rates, reinforcing training importance.

- **Chart 4 – Training Score vs. Emails Clicked**  
  *Type:* Line Chart  
  *Insight:* Higher training scores correlate with fewer clicks, though users with mid-range scores (~85) showed unexpectedly high click behavior.

- **Chart 5 – Tenure vs. Emails Clicked**  
  *Type:* Scatter Plot  
  *Insight:* There is a negative correlation between tenure and phishing susceptibility. More experienced employees tend to be more cautious.

### 🧑‍💼 HR Manager Insights Dashboard

Enables strategic monitoring of training outcomes and risk levels across departments.

- **Chart 1 – Training Completion by Department**  
  *Type:* Stacked Bar Chart  
  *Insight:* IT and Finance had the highest training completion rates; Sales had the lowest. This highlights where training rollout needs reinforcement.

- **Chart 2 – Attendance Rate vs. Training Score**  
  *Type:* Scatter Plot  
  *Insight:* Higher attendance correlates with higher scores, showing that participation consistency improves learning outcomes.

- **Chart 3 – Average Training Score by Department**  
  *Type:* Bar Chart  
  *Insight:* Marketing led with the highest average training scores, while Sales and Finance lagged behind.

- **Chart 4 – Effect of Age and Tenure on Risk Level**  
  *Type:* Combo Chart (Bar for Age, Line for Tenure)  
  *Insight:* Younger, newer employees tend to have higher risk levels. Older, long-tenured staff appear more cyber-aware and cautious.
